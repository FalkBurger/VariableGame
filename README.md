# VariableGame
A game where the only concept I have for it is that it should involve variables

Strength(Str) determines how much damage physical attacks do as well as your health

Dexterity(Dex) determines how well you dodge attacks and make ranged attacks

Willpower(Will) determines how much magic you can cast as well as what level spells you can use

Intelligence(Int) determines how well your spells perform and modifies magical attacks
